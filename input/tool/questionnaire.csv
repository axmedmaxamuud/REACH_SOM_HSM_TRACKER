select_one y_n,consent,"Hi, my name is __________. I work for REACH, an initiative of ACTED INGO. We are currently conducting a survey to understand remote locations that have little humanitarian access. We would like to know more about the settlement in which you lived before moving to location where you are staying currently. We also may ask you a few questions about yourself personally. The survey will take about 25 to 60 minutes to complete. Any information that you provide will be kept strictly confidential. This is voluntary and you can choose not to answer any or all of the questions if you want; you may also choose to quit at any point. However, we hope that you will participate since your views are important. Responses are not directly tied to any form of humanitarian assistance and answers given in this interview will not directly affect any status as a beneficiary or non-beneficiary.

note,covid_note,"As a humanitarian agency, we would like to inform you about current pandemic of coronavirus infection. The virus is highly contagious and spreads person to person. You can get infected through handshake, hug or standing very close to an infected person (less than 1 meter), and also through touching the surfaces that were touched by someone who is sick, and then putting hands on your face and eyes. 

The symptoms of disease include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.

You can protect yourself and help prevent spreading the virus to others if you:

Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water 
Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
Avoid close contact (1 meter) with people who are unwell
Stay home and self-isolate from other people if you feel unwell and advice people with symptoms of disease to do so
Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean
Try as much as possible to use contactless payment methods and limit the use of paper money. Also, wash your hands thoroughly each time after you touch the money or any other surface which is exposed.

Please note that using medical masks alone does not provide sufficient level of protection. They can only be effective if combined with frequent hand cleaning with soap and water, and only if single-use masks are disposed after each use.","Ka hay'ad samafal ahaan, waxaan jeclaan lahayn inaan kugu wargalinno masiibada cudurka hadda jira ee caabuqa corona fayras. fayraskan si weyn ayuu ufaafayaa wuxuuna ufidayaa min qof ilaa qof.
